Since I'm active on Twitch again, I thought it'd be important to list and/or state some important things here, to answer any potential frequently asked questions.

*Rules, etiquette and others are discussed on Discord!* Invitation link: <https://discord.gg/4s3Qhx5>

## Hardware

*November 2020 - currently*:
* computer: **Dell XPS 15** - [specifications](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/xps-15-9560-laptop/xps-15-9560-setupandspecifications/specifications?guid=guid-4a715843-271e-4d93-b41c-66a245385203&lang=en-us), no upgrade

### Earlier

*October 2020*: **Lenovo ThinkPad T510** - [specifications](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd003320-detailed-specifications-thinkpad-t510-t510i-w510), RAM upgraded to 8GB


## Software

For broadcasting I use [**Streamlabs OBS**](https://streamlabs.com/).

[Twitch Studio](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/studio) was also used, for earlier streams.

## Streaming schedule

It's not a secret I'm a full-time developer and it gets ultimate priority over streaming. As such, I have very little saying in streaming dates: it's sporadic and unpredictable.

Rule-of-thumbs as of January 2021:
* *Mondays are always non-streaming days.*
* *Tuesdays are always streaming days.*
* *There are two fix streams each week.* More, if I'm lucky.

In the #schedule channel of [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/4s3Qhx5) has a constantly updated schedule calendar I use as a reference point for more detailed dates.

## Games

The central focus is on Doom mods, but on occasion, I do walkthroughs of other games. These subjects vary in quality and genre; most of them are obscure, but even if not, I have an emphasis on cyberpunk-themed games.

[**List of played and planned Doom mods**](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/modlist)

Other games played:

* [Among Us](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/stream-archive#among-us)
* **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** (no backup yet)
* [Broken Reality](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/stream-archive#broken-reality)
* [Creeper World 4](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/stream-archive#creeper-world-4)
* [Deus Ex](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/stream-archive#redsun-2020)
* [NeonCode](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/stream-archive#neoncode)
* [The Red Strings Club](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/stream-archive#the-red-strings-club)
* [VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/stream-archive#va-11-hall-A-cyberpunk-bartender-action)

Requests are accepted on popular demand, within my possibilities.

## Music

* [streamre Ã¶mlesztett nemcsaksynthwavees](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4VO3UX3rNi1XOQXQ3NfLOS)
* [\[majdnem\] minden magyar synthwave](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6TjTsOheKHChojSv7aWtGF)

On a case-by-case basis, I tend to turn off ingame music, and play my own selection of music.

Such background music is always played on Spotify; these are the playlists I use the most frequently.

I try to focus on small artists for giving them exposue and to avoid muting from Twitch.

## Art

### Atis1

Since I'm active on Twitch again, I thought it'd be important to list and/or state some important things here, to answer any potential frequently asked questions.

## Hardware

As of November 2020, every stream is recorded on a **Lenovo ThinkPad T510** laptop. 

It's way, **way** not ideal for streaming so I'd spare you with the specs. The only upgrade it got so far was a RAM extension (from 4 to 8 GB) anyways.

## Software

For broadcasting I used [**Streamlabs OBS**](https://streamlabs.com/).

[Twitch Studio](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/studio) was also used, for earlier streams.

## Games

As of November 2020 I'm centrally focusing on playing Doom mods.

Other games played on occasion:

* [Among Us](https://katamori.github.io/twitch/stream-archive#among-us)
* **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** (no backup yet)

Requests are accepted on popular demand, within my possibilities.

## Music

* [\[majdnem\] minden magyar synthwave](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6TjTsOheKHChojSv7aWtGF)

I always play background music on Spotify; these are the playlists I use the most frequently.

I try to focus on small artists for giving them exposue and to avoid muting from Twitch.

## Art

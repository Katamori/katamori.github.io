Worldbuilding is the creative process of creating an imaginary world, plain and simple. For a very long time, it hasn't been his own separate activity; instead, it was linked to other creative processes, such as writing or tabletop role-playing.

During and after 2014, I encountered miscellaneous obstacles in the way of my other creative endeavours, and as a culmination of those (with the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/worldbuilding" target="_blank">help of Reddit</a>), I started dealing with worldbuilding as a personal, recreational activity. For a very long time, it was productivity-focused, with the specific strict intention to <i>make something out of it</i>; since 2018 it's only a soft goal.
